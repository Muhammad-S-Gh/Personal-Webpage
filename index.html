                        Dynamic and detail-oriented Backend Developer specializing in Laravel (PHP) and NestJS
                        (TypeScript). Currently pursuing a degree in Information Technology Engineering, I have designed
                        and implemented RESTful APIs, optimized database schemas, and developed scalable, secure, and
                        high-performance server-side applications across academic and personal projects. I’m skilled at
                        translating requirements into clean, maintainable code with best practices. Passionate about
                        solving complex backend challenges, I aim to contribute to innovative projects that deliver
                        real-world impact while collaborating with experienced developers. Beyond technology, my
                        experience as a Paramedic with the Syrian Arab Red Crescent has strengthened my teamwork,
                        adaptability, and commitment to precision and responsibility under pressure. I’m eager to bring
                        this same focus and dedication to my journey as a backend developer.

                        Throughout my development journey, I have gained extensive hands-on experience in backend
                        design, database architecture, and web application development. I’ve created multiple
                        applications that showcase both technical depth and practical functionality. Among my most
                        notable projects are Telebat, a Laravel 12 multi-vendor e-commerce platform featuring
                        single-cart checkout, robust authentication, and advanced backend logic, and Arenalink, a
                        reservation management system for sports facilities built with NestJS, incorporating secure
                        authentication, efficient database schema design, and an EAV (Entity-Attribute-Value) model for
                        flexible data handling. These projects allowed me to work with key technologies and integrations
                        such as Stripe, PayPal, Firebase, and Swagger. Currently, I am strengthening my skills by
                        developing full-stack projects to gain deeper expertise and hands-on experience across modern
                        backend and frontend technologies.
